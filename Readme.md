# Welcome!

## Let‚Äôs bootstrap the project

Some basic skeleton. We‚Äôll use composer to manage autoloading and dependencies.

```
composer init
```

We‚Äôll be doing some unit tests, so `phpunit` is a dev requirement, but let‚Äôs add
some static analysis and code style tools too. Add them to `scripts` section,
this way composer will be our task runner. 

Next: autoloading.

Since there are a lot of namespaces, let‚Äôs use an empty PSR-4 prefix for "src".

## Next we‚Äôre adding the existing sources

Just drop them in the src directory. It lights up like a christmas tree, but
that is ok for now, we‚Äôll handle that in the next step.

## Provide some deps for `InventoryService`

Monolog and Guzzle are some fine implementations of the PSR standards, we will
use them. I could not find the Allegro SDK on packagist, so I will stub that
along with the Aterian dependencies.

## Quickly check what phpstan thinks

It complains about the logger assignment in the constructor, saying that the
readonly property is already assigned. It‚Äôs not, but let‚Äôs please it. Explicitly
using `else` is nothing that I commonly do either way, let‚Äôs replace it with
a simple ternary.

## All done, we can start refactoring

The code ‚Äûcompiles‚Äù, so we can start refactoring. But let‚Äôs have a safety net:
an e2e test. Or maybe a unit test? The service does rather a lot, so let‚Äôs treat
it as a whole system. The difference between unit and e2e is not that large, we
treat the SUT as a blackbox either way.

The first challenge is to understand the requirements. Fortunately, the code is
quite easy to understand. We have some inventory, we need to update product
quantities in different channels, depending if the product should be published
in each of them.

I guess we‚Äôll test for that alone, anticipating that any other responsibilities
will be just implementation details.

For simple units the Arrange Act Assert test format is fine, but for brevity
we‚Äôll use gherkin-like syntax here, using descriptions closer to entire use
cases. 

A lot is happening behind the scenes: Mothers and Stubs are created to help us
keep the test case cleaner and more readable.

Meanwhile, the `AllegroSellerAccounts` stub will be converted from an interface
(it was just a stub after all) to a concrete class. It seems it is just 
a collection, so let‚Äôs slap an `IteratorAggregate` on it and be done with it.

Running tests confirms that all is green. Thank you üôá

## Looking at some static analysis

At this point `phpstan` thinks everything is fine-and-dandy. 
But I know it isn‚Äôt. Let‚Äôs turn up the nitpickingness to 11.
After adding some draconian rules it starts reporting 14 issues.
They are easy to fix, no worries.

Except for one, but it‚Äôs in the class under refactoring, 
so I‚Äôll handle that later I guess.

## Add some assertions

Ok, I cheated a little. There were no assertions in the test, so let‚Äôs quickly
fix that with a spy. The SUT‚Äôs responsibility is to send a message (have a side
effect) to the AllegroSDK, so let‚Äôs verify that it does.

```
$ phpunit
F.
```

Shit. 

## Debugging

Fortunately it was just me not knowing PHP. After fixing the spy, the test
actually passes. 

## More test cases

Let‚Äôs handle other code paths and some edge cases. For this we will need another
spy for the website sdk-thing. Same stuff, different names. While we‚Äôre at it, 
let‚Äôs fix the bug in the Http Client interface (`request` vs `sendRequest`).

This introduces a dependency on Guzzle into our SUT, but just for a little 
while, this will be fixed soon.

## Starting the refactoring

The first obvious choice would be abstracting the sales channel handlers. 
So let‚Äôs do that. The e2e will not change that much, because we want to retain
the observable behaviour ‚Äî so we‚Äôre basically expecting the same side effects
for the same context.

We are doing this in steps. We will plainly move the logic to separate classes. 
Look how the creation of SUT changes ‚Äî the existing deps are now passed to
additional updaters, not much changes.

## Moving the guards

Each of the sales channel implementation will have a guard at the top.
We‚Äôll exit early if the channel is not supported for a given product. We could
be tempted to extract this guard and use a decorator pattern, and have a factory
to put it all together‚Ä¶ I will implement that just as a showcase, but it has its
downsides, and I think the final code would lack readability. If I made such 
decision IRL, I would leave a similar comment in review.

Let‚Äôs add some negative constraints, because we are not really testing whether 
website is updated for allegro products and vice versa. That‚Äôs great: test fails
before I decorate the website updater with a guard.

We‚Äôve combined the updater logic with the guard decorator using a factory. It‚Äôs
placed in the `Application` layer, but we have a strong argument to claim that 
this is domain logic, but let‚Äôs not dive into that right now.

And finally, since the strong type on `WebsiteUpdater` is no longer valid 
(it‚Äôs wrapped with in a guard), let‚Äôs go all the way in and remove the allegro
updater requirement and expect a generic list of updaters.

## Restore the logic of composing updaters

At this point the sole responsibility of the SUT is to fetch SKU from the 
inventory and iterate on updaters. The unit test for that could be much simpler,
but let‚Äôs keep our e2e test for now.

Hmm, but we‚Äôve lost the logic of selecting the updaters and calling them in the 
correct order. We need to restore that, let‚Äôs make a factory. This way the 
service itself represents the unit of logic, but the factory reflects more the
system as a whole.

The naming might require a change to reflect the *specific* use case this
factory implements, but let‚Äôs KISS for now.

## Error handling

Before we move on, let‚Äôs change the behaviour a bit and add some error handling.
The updaters will be independent, and failure of one won‚Äôt affect another. 
A separate test will assert that. Since it is a new feature, we can go full
TDD on it: first the test case, red, implement, green.

The exception class could use some love, but that‚Äôs for a later date. To avoid 
discarding exceptions, let‚Äôs move the logger here, and remove the logging from
the WebsiteUpdater for now (it will reemmerge later). I‚Äôm sure of it, because 
I left a todo comment. :)

Ok, we‚Äôre green, let‚Äôs commit and move on to other adventures.


## Refactoring WebsiteUpdater

There is a lot to unpack here, but basically this unit has multiple 
responsibilities, spanning across multiple layers. How to reason about it‚Ä¶?
We will treat it as a glorified http request builder. It would seem that we
shouldn‚Äôt shove http requests into our core domain, but on the other hand, 
having an abstraction over that would be over-engineering.

Should logger be a part of the domain? Depending on how strict we are, but I
could defend that argument for a long time if need be.

Wrapping scalars in POPOs is good for type guarantees and for autowiring!

To sum up:

 * The `getenv` call is moved to app layer (probs framework will take care of
   that either way), and inside the domain we expect the value to be injected
 * The `HttpClient` was replaced ‚Äî this way we keep the domain pure, and
   implement the actual adapter in the infra layer. That also removes the 
   dependency on Guzzle I talked about earlier
 * The logging was pushed down to the `HttpClient` using the decorator pattern.
   Not sure if that‚Äôs the requirement, but hey, there are no requirements, 
   I‚Äôm just coding blind ;)
 * On the context boundary, the exceptions are mapped, so implementation 
   details don‚Äôt leak.

Let‚Äôs save some time and skip testing if the requests are logged, but we will
refactor it using the decorator pattern either way. And scrub the secrets
while we‚Äôre at it, yikes!

## Remove the `production` flag

The core domain has no concept of production or dev environments, it does what
its told. So let‚Äôs tell it. The logic to detect production mode is once again
moved to the Application layer, and once more we can probably rely on the
framework to handle it.
